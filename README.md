# About Me


As an aspiring ethical hacker with a penchant for problem-solving and exploration, I thrive on the dynamic challenges posed by cybersecurity. While my background may not be rooted in the field, my passion drives me to continuously learn and adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and emerging threats. With a natural inclination to investigate and tinker, I'm on a mission to carve my path in cybersecurity, one puzzle at a time.
